# Cinema Management System (OOP)

This project is a simple cinema management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The system allows users to view available movies, book tickets, and add snacks to their orders. It also manages cinema halls, checks seat availability, and provides an interface for both regular and premium users.

## Features

- **User Management**:  
  Users can log in to the system, with support for both regular and premium users.

- **Movie Management**:  
  View movies with details such as title, genre, show date, and rating. Users can also filter and sort movies by various attributes.

- **Ticket Booking**:  
  Book tickets for available movies with real-time seat availability checks.

- **Snack Ordering**:  
  Add snacks to your order while booking tickets.

- **Cinema Hall Management**:  
  Manage cinema hall details such as capacity and availability.
